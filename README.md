# MechanicalPrograms_small
These are small programs to help in common MechE Undergrad problems from homework, labs, and more.
The programs are primarily written in MATLAB and Julia; each will require their respective environments
to run on your computer. Most programs utilize packages/toolboxes/dependencies that are not in the 
standard libraries or immediately invoked in the compiler. You will need to install these for the 
programs to work; they will be named in a comment for each file. From the license, and my own 
interpretation, you are free to do anything with the files presented.
