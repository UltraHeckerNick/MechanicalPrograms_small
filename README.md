# MechanicalPrograms_small
These are small programs to help in common MechE Undergrad problems from homework, labs, and more.
The programs are primarily written in MATLAB and Julia; each will require their respective environments
to run on your computer. From the license, and my own interpretation, you are free to do anything 
with the files presented (contribution is encouraged).
