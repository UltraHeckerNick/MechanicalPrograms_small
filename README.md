# MechanicalPrograms_small
These are small programs to help in common MechE Undergrad problems from homework, labs, and more.
The programs are primarily written in MATLAB and Julia; each will require their respective environments
to run on your computer. Julia is ideal if you do not already have a MATLAB license, though you may be able
to run certain files on MATLAB's website or convert for use in GNU Octave or Scilab. Anyone, for free, 
can download and run Julia files simply by downloading the compiler from their site. It will run in the 
terminal of your Operating System. Some programs are hard coded, meaning deviations from problems discussed
or conversion for a separate problem will require editing the code in an editor of choice (or in MATLAB). 
Others will prompt the user for inputs. The code is not intended to be production ready or even project 
ready; some may output plots, while others will only output answers to the command line, amongst other 
methods.
